# CloudwatchPoller

This is a celluloid process that polls cloudwatch metrics and logs them to
STDOUT for consumption by other systems.

Written for a hack week, so it's more of a tech demo than a useful product. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cloudwatch_poller'

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cloudwatch_poller
